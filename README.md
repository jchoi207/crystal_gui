## GUI for .hp files
- Instead of parsing through individual ```.hp``` files, this GUI allows you to view the entire database in a more user-friendly manner. 
- The user can trash individual images. Note these files are recoverable if the user copies the ```.hp``` file before trashing. 

## Usage
1. Place your ```.hp``` files at [patterns](patterns)
2. Run the script [GUI.py](GUI.py)
    - To install required packages run ```pip install requirements.txt``` in your venv or conda environment
